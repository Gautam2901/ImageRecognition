Build an Image Recognition Application using Python, TensorFlow, and Flask

Goal

Create an Image Recognition Web Application that classifies images into different categories using TensorFlow for the machine learning model and Flask for the web server. The application enables users to upload images and receive predictions.

Steps to Complete the Project

Step 1: Install Necessary Software

Ensure Python, TensorFlow, Flask, and Pillow are installed.

Step 2: Set Up the Project Directory

Create a project folder named ImageRecognitionApp.

Inside it, create subfolders static for uploaded images and templates for HTML files.

Step 3: Set Up the Machine Learning Model

Download and save a pre-trained model like MobileNetV2.

Create a Python script to load the model and define a function to predict image labels.

Step 4: Set Up the Flask Web Application

Develop a Flask application to handle routes for uploading images and displaying results.

Implement image upload functionality, save the files, and integrate the prediction logic.

Step 5: Create HTML Templates

Home Page: A simple form to upload images.

Result Page: Displays the uploaded image, predicted label, and confidence level.

Step 6: Run the Application

Start the Flask server by running python app.py.

Access the web application at http://127.0.0.1:5000 and test it by uploading images.

Step 7: Track Changes Using Git

Initialize a Git repository in the project folder.

Add files and commit changes.

Final Output

Upon completion, you will have a functional Image Recognition Web Application that:

Allows users to upload images.

Provides accurate predictions with confidence scores.

This project combines machine learning, web development, and image processing, offering hands-on experience in building an end-to-end solution.
